## What is Fibonacci Dao?

&#x20;Fibonacci Dao is the first decentralized reserve pool which is available on the **Polygon Network** based on the **FIB** token. Each **FIB** token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., MIM, ETH, MATIC Tokens) in the Fibonacci Dao treasury, giving it an intrinsic value letting only our NFT holders access. **Fibonacci Dao** also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting.

## How do you participate?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, native to the **Matic** network, in which the behavior of the **FBD** token! In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency thus causing **FBD** as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for giving access to the users to stake their NFT by giving out FBD in a timely period.&#x20;

We intend to achieve an intrinsic price value for a representative basket of goods without the use of fiat currency, in order to allow the cryptocurrency industry to detach once and for all from the traditional finance world!
